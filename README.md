Discription for the Project
# IOT section:

we are using ESP 32 Wroom devkit-1 in this
project. This project is about the connectivity
of our appliances with a single tap and
monitering mode of our devices.In this project
we communicated the ESP with Wifi
connectivity through a web server.We
connected a relay with ESP-32 which will be
operated through Wifi and operate our
appliances through Wifi.

The web server you'll build controls two LEDs
connected to the ESP32 GPIO 26 and GPIO
27;

You can access the ESP32 web server by
typing the ESP32 IP address on a browser in
the local network;

By clicking the buttons on your web server
you can instantly change the state of each
LED.

# WORKING:

Firstly connect the ESP-32 with Wifi by Wifi
address and password. after connecting it
with wifi we will connect a relay with ESP-32
which will control all the electronical devices
we have to control / stay connected. Giving
supply to relay with both ESP-32 and external
sources. Relay output ports will be connected
to the bulb or other electronical devices.

We will get information through Wifi interface
on or mobiles or laptops.

# Confirmation:

use web admin console and press a button on
webpage to turn the lights ON/OFF
